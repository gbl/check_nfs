Depending on your NFS server, you might need to install these two plugins
suid root (chown root check_nfs*; chmod 4750 check_nfs*). This is because
NFS servers often disallow mount requests from non-privileged ports, and
the plugins need root rights to bind to a privileged port when mounting.

On linux, instead of setting the suid bit, you can also use the
cap_net_bind_service capability:
	setcap cap_net_bind_service+ep check_nfs
	setcap cap_net_bind_service+ep check_nfs_file

Usage:
	check_nfs <server> <share> <warn> <crit>
	e.g.
	check_nfs usersrv homes 10% 5%

and

	check_nfs_file <server> <directory> <file>
	e.g.
	check_nfs_file usersrv homes/john .profile
