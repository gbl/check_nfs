Version 0.02:	made the plugins compile under AIX:
	- renamed fh_len to fh_length in a few places because fh_len is a
	  #define macro in AIX
	- zero out the getaddrinfo hints structure in both main's
	- adjust printf (%lld) to data type (long long)
	- changed Makefiles to always use gcc and -g
	- some typedefs depending on _AIX
	- use &rpc_createerr on AIX which doesn't have get_rpc_createerr
	- include sys/types.h and stdlib.h where appropriate
	- use xdr_[u_]hyper instead of missing xdr_[u_]quad
	- use xdr_int instead of xdr_long for 32-bit entities
	- bump version to 0.02

Version 0.01:	first released version
